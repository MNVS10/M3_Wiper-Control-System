# Abstract #

Wiper is an equipment used in vehicles to clean and wipe out water and dust particles from the wind screen. It is practically not possible for a driver to clean the windscreen while driving in rain. Hence there is a high necessary for a mechanism to do this job in a sigle click. Thus the objective of the project is to develop
a mechanism to clean the windscreen at different speed respective to the rate of rainfall. The project is developed using STM32 ARM based controller.
