# Abstract #

Wiper is an equipment used in vehicles to clean and wipe out water and dust particles from the wind screen. It is practically not possible for a driver to clean the windscreen while driving in rain. Hence there is a high necessary for a mechanism to do this job in a sigle click. Thus the objective of the project is to develop
a mechanism to clean the windscreen while the  vehicle is running. This project also aims to clean the wind screen at different speed respective to the rate of rainfall.
Thus providing a clear vison to the driver for a safe driving.The project is developed using STM32 ARM based controller.


# Requirements #
  * Red led to show the state of engine,
  * Blue, Green and Orange LED to show the path of Wiper.
  * STM32CubeIDE

# SWOT Analysis:
	
	Strength:Provide a clean vison and comfortable driving to the driver.
	Weakness: Adding this mechanism to older vechiles is difficult.
	Opportunities: All vechicles can be made with this mechanism at low cost.
	Threats:Making the drivers aware of the requirement of this mechanism.
